          <div>I have a strong commitment to providing excellent experiences for clients. I have always been playing one or multiple sports, starting with youth soccer and basketball. 
            When I was 13 my first weightlifting experience was at my high school weight room for football. Iâ€™ll never forget the atmosphere, environment, and life lessons I was taught.<br></br> <br></br>  
            During college, I was known for staying in the campus gym and sharing my knowledge and experiences with my friends, as well as playing Collegiate Rugby. <br></br><br></br>  I am now experienced 
            in personal training and group exercise instruction, with a certification from NASM as well as a B.S. in Exercise Science. I would absolutely love to be apart of your fitness 
            journey and your story.</div>
